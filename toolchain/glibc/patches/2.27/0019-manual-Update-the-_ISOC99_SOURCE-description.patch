Subject: [PATCH 019/174] manual: Update the _ISOC99_SOURCE description.

The current description refers to ISO C99 not being widely adopted,
which it is believed to be now.

	* manual/creature.texi (_ISOC99_SOURCE): Update the dated
	description.

(cherry picked from commit e8d190b9ed81a1b342f0969bc2b5505403183bce)
