    qualcommax: ipq5018: gl-b3000: fix rootfs_size in bootscript
    
    rootfs_size was being set after the bootscript was already copied
    to KDIR_TMP/ this was sneaky because it only affected the initial
    compile. All subsequent compiles the rootfs_size is correct before
    the copy is made and the bug goes un discovered. Hence the reason I
    missed it during testing.
    
    this patch fixes the issue and also refactors the
    make recipe to update rootfs_size after the copy
    is made, and updates the copy exclusively.
    
    Fixes: 3307fe8ee4cf ("qualcommax: ipq50xx: add support for GL.iNET GL-B3000")
