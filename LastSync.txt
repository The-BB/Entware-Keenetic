    Revert "ath79: elecom,wab: use nvmem"
    
    This reverts commit 70e41d0205d95386881fa1cdf6ee00f6cca1b3f6.
    
    "ethaddr" is stored into the "u-boot-env" (stock: "Config") partition
    and it's quoted with double-quotations, but that format is not supported
    by the current NVMEM u-boot-env driver (and mac_pton() function) and the
    MAC address won't be parsed to byte array.
    This causes random MAC addresses on the adapters, so revert the above
    commit.
