    x86: switch config to a tickless kernel
    
    This commit fixes and closes #16313.
    
    Switch the x86 kernel's timer to tickless operation which is
    more power efficient since it is not woken up by periodic timer
    interrupts when idle.  Also add several other options for CPU
    idle governors particularly the upstream default for tickless
    kernels, CONFIG_CPU_IDLE_GOV_MENU. Without this commit, my AMD
    Ryzen 7 5800U can only achieve a minimum core frequency of 1,384
    MHz which is over 3x higher than the processor's minimum
    frequency of 400 MHz which is accessible with this modification.
    In addition to the lower clock rate, I have seen a concomitant
    reduction in both idle temps and at-the-wall power consumption.
    
    Summary:
    * Idle CPU freqs dropped from 1,384 MHz to 400 Mhz.
    * Idle power consumption dropped from 7 W avg to 5 W.
    * Idle temps have dropped from 50C on avg to 43C.
    
    There are other well known reasons to switch to a tickless
    timer including: reduced interrupt overhead, better use of CPU
    resources, and reduced latency to name a few.
