    realtek: phy: add basic RTL8218B setup
    
    On some devices (like ZyXEL GS1920) the phys are not initialized and patched
    by the bootloader. This is done through the vendor SDK when the software
    starts. To make these devices usable too, provide the most basic setup
    sequence for the RTL8218B.
