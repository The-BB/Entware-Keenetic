    kernel: usbnet: Restore usb%d naming for cdc-ethernet devices with local MAC
    
    Prior to commit https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/8a7d12d674ac6f2147c18f36d1e15f1a48060edf,
    cdc-ethernet USB LTE modems (e.g. Quectel EC200A) were consistently named
    usb0. After 8a7d12d67, devices began renaming to eth1 due to an assumption
    that local MAC addresses originate exclusively from the kernel. Some
    devices provide driver-assigned local MACs, causing point-to-point
    interfaces with driver-set MACs to adopt eth%d names instead of usb%d.
    
    Restore the naming exception for point-to-point devices: interfaces
    without driver MACs or with driver-provided local MACs will retain the
    usb%d convention. This addresses issues reported in [1] and fixed in [2].
