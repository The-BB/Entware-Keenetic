    tools/libressl: update to 4.0.0
    
    Stable version. Odd versions are betas.
    
    Added static patch to rename some ecdsa symbols that conflict with
    u-boot's mkimage.
    
    These symbols are not exported by default but because OpenWrt uses a
    static libressl, they are present and conflict with mkimage's libecdsa.
