    realtek: Split Zyxel GS1900-8 into v1 and v2
    
    Zyxel GS1900-8 v2 devices have been produced more recently than v1
    devices. As there are v1 boards with RTL8380M rev. C SoCs, it can likely
    safely be assumed that all v2 devices will also have a recent SoC
    revision, supporting the hardware auxiliary MDIO controller.
    
    Make the GS1900-8 v1 use an emulated auxiliary MDIO bus, for backward
    compatibility with devices containing an RTL8380M rev. A.
    
    Since the devicetrees are otherwise identical, GS1900-8 v1 devices with
    an RTL8380M rev. B or C will also be able to use the (more efficient) v2
    image. This includes any currently functioning device with OpenWrt, so
    include the old compatible as a supported device for the GS1900-8 v2.
