    bcm27xx: base-files: diag: improve LEDs behaviour
    
    As reported in https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/issues/15834 using the PWR
    LED for indicating diag status is confusing since this is usually used for
    power supply failures on RPi devices.
    This commit uses ACT LED for diag status and restores it to mmc activity.
