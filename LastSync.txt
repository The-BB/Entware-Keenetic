    scripts: getver.sh: approximate version from date
    
    When doing package support and management it is often the case that
    knowing the corresponding openwrt repo's release version is useful.
    
    For example, when adding package changes to the ASU server, the
    openwrt revision is used as the cutoff for applying those changes.
    Knowing a package change's hash in its remote feed repo allows us
    to look up its change date, which we can now use with getver.sh
    to approximate the revision in openwrt at which it was made.
