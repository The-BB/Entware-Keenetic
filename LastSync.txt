    imagebuilder: fix OPKG package_whatdepends support
    
    Trying to use 'package_whatdepends' feature of the ImageBuilder with OPKG
    will currently fail as OPKG does not support "list --depends" call at all,
    it seems that this is a mixup from the original APK support commit.
    
    So, lets restore 'package_whatdepends' support for OPKG by calling
    "whatdepends -A" instead as we used to before APK support.
    
    Fixes: d788ab376f85 ("build: add APK package build capabilities")
