    generic: Fix up the v6.12 config for ARM
    
    This adds a few ARM-related kconfig options that makes the
    configure phase smooth on ARM (32bit) systems.
    
    We default PAN to enabled for protection, however this has
    a syscall speed penalty, if your system is interacting a lot
    from userspace you might want to disable it for speed vs
    security. For in-kernel routing it should not be a major
    issue.
    
    Some marginal ARM system enables DRM so make sure we have
    the related DRM Kconfigs set up to unselected.
