    wifi-scripts: add hotplug handler for slow-to-initialize ath12k radios
    
    Some ath12k radios can take long time to initialize and register a
    phy. This can cause netifd to fail to detect them during initial scan.
    To address this issue, a hotplug script has been added to retry
    configuration once they have registered their phy.
