    toolchain: gcc: 15: fix build error with glibc for aarch64 targets
    
    GCC 14+ fails to build due to libatomic specific -march handling.
    This build error triggers only with glibc and not with musl libc
    which is default.
    
    It seems that this patch from GCC14 was forgotten when GCC15 support was
    being added [1].
