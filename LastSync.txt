    uboot-mediatek: restore Ethernet PHY drivers
    
    Partially revert commit 332645a610 ("uboot-mediatek: sync with
    mtk-openwrt/u-boot 20250711") by dropping unused PHY drivers which come
    with large embedded firmware (and are hence inacceptable for upstream)
    and restoring our previous version of the Airoha EN8811H driver which is
    known to work and load firmware from the eMMC boot1 hardware partition
    instead of embedding it in the driver.
    
    In future we may switch to the upstream Airoha EN8811H driver which
    allows loading the firmware either from a filesystem or overloading the
    en8811h_read_fw() for board which may eg. store that firmware directly
    inside a eMMC hardware partition or UBI volume, like the BPi-R3 mini
    does.
