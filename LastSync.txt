    mtd-utils: add ubihealthd to nand-utils
    
    Add ubihealthd to the nand-utils package, auto-create UCI config for
    each UBI device and launch the daemon on boot.
    
    The default time interval between scrubbing a random PED is 120 seconds
    which means that a fully used 128 MiB flash chip gets scrubbed in about
    a day and a half. The interval can be adjusted in UCI using the
    'interval' option.
