    generic: net: phy: realtek: work-around hang on SerDes setup
    
    On some but not all devices using the RTL8221B 2.5GBit/s PHY the SerDes
    setup sequence may hang under some circumstances (eg. <2500M link
    partner present during boot).
    
    RTL8221B-VB-CG 2.5Gbps PHY (C45) mdio-bus:01: rtl822xb_config_init failed: -110
    
    Work-around the issue by performing a hardware reset and subsequent
    retry of the SerDes setup, which seems to always succeed.
    
    Doing this requires moving ALDPS setup to config_init (which is anyway
    the better place for that) as it otherwise doesn't survive the reset.
    
    Also disable listening on MDIO address 0 which may be used by other PHYs
    despite being spec'ed as "broadcast address", as bus activity on address
    0 may otherwise confuse the RealTek PHY for good reasons.
