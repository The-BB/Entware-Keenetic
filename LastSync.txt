    qualcommax: ipq50xx: drop unused factory.ubi for ELECOM WRC-X3000GS2
    
    Drop the firmware image entry "factory.ubi" from IMAGES for ELECOM
    WRC-X3000GS2.
    `Device/UbiFit` is added in the early stage of working for adding
    support of the device, but finally, only `KERNEL_IN_UBI` is neccesary
    and factory.ubi is not. So `Device/UbiFit` should have been replaced
    to `KERNEL_IN_UBI` but it was forgotten.
