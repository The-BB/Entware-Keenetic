    ipq806x: Revert "ipq806x: swap lan leds for Meraki MR52"
    
    This reverts commit ec8f647d168fa8f3b1eedd9b5fe665f793f3a659, as with the
    current kernel version, the change actually causes the same bug it once
    may have fixed -- that is, the leds are now again reversed.
    
    I suspect this was due to a switch to a newer kernel version between when
    the patch was submitted and now reversing the order of the interfaces, so
    that eth0 / the LAN interface is also the interface used for PoE, and eth1
    / the WAN interface is the non-PoE interface.
