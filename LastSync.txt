    bpftool: add host build
    
    Besides probing BPF information in running system, bpftool is also used in
    generating skeleton, dumping BTF, etc. that is widely used in modern BPF
    development. Make it available as a host tool so that we can use it in
    package build.
    
    Tested build targeting malta/le on Arch Linux x86_64. bpftools currently
    does not support processing cross-endian BPF objects, so big-endian host
    is needed to build for big-endian targets using bpftools.
