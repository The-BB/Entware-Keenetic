    uboot-tools: dont build tools unconditionally
    
    Currently, both envtools and the rest of U-Boot tools are being built
    regardless if the dumpimage package has been selected.
    
    This will fail if only envtools are selected since the rest of tools
    require OpenSSL while envtools do not require them.
    
    So, only build tools if dumpimage is selected.

    Fixes: #18327
