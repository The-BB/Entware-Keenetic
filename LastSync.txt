    generic: 5.15, 6.1: enable CNP support
    
    Ever since CONFIG_ARM64_PAN was enabled Common Not Private (CNP) is now
    visible and kernel builds will stop as they are not set in kernel config
    for 5.15 and 6.1.
    
    So, lets enable Common Not Private (CNP) which is ARMv8.2 feature and will
    be NOP of CPU-s that dont support it.
