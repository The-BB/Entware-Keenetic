    mold: dont allow on MacOS
    
    Mold does not really work on MacOS, when attempting to use it for example
    for ubus:
    mold: get_self_path is not supportedcollect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
    
    Which was introduced by [1] so it seems that MacOS is not supported, so
    lets make it non selectable when MacOS is the host.
