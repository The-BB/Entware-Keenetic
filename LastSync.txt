    ramips: mt7621: support openwrt,netdev-name for renaming interfaces
    
    Edgerouter X currently has its eth1 port on the switch missing since there
    is a naming conflict currently.
    
    So, as the root cause is mixing kernel support for DSA interfaces having
    predictable names set via "label" property vs others having it assigned
    dynamically lets avoid the conflict by using our own custom property as
    suggested upstream [1].
    
    So, add support via "openwrt,netdev-name" property and use it on ERX.
    
    Fixes: 2a25c6ace8d8 ("ramips: get rid of downstream network device label patch")
    Fixes: #15643
