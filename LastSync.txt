    toolchain/wrapper: add missing qstrip to info.mk export
    
    When using an external toolchain, the SetToolchainInfo function
    is missing a qstrip call on GCC_VERSION, which results in quotes
    making it to the toolchain info.mk file.
    
    This leads to a failure to build the libgcc ipk package because
    the quotes make it to its version and filename. For some reason,
    it only fails on the first make invocation, but succeeds on
    subsequent ones on my setup.
    
    Fix this issue by adding the qstrip, making it consistent with
    the internal toolchain approach.
