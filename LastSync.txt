    uboot-d1: Adapt BUILD_DEVICES to renamed boards
    
    The boards where renamed, but BUILD_DEVICES was not adapted. This
    variable points to the board name. Without this change the u-boot
    binaries are not selected in the configuration.
    
    Copy the u-boot binaries under the BUILD_DEVICES name as it is expected
    by the image scripts.
