    hostapd: fix sta psk index for dynamic psk auth
    
    Depending on the config / circumstances, the get_psk call can be called
    multiple times from differnt places, which can lead to wrong sta->psk_idx
    values. The correct call is the one that is also interested in the vlan_id,
    so use the vlan_id pointer as indication of when to set sta->psk_idx.
    Also fix off-by-one error for secondary PSKs
