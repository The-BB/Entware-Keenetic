    kernel: switch crc32 implementation back to default
    
    Commit ec885796c05a switched the crc32 implementation from default to
    byte-at-a-time algorithm, which runs slower but consumes less memory.
    A decade has passed, and we have already abandoned targets that had
    small memory, so switch it back to default for faster speed.
