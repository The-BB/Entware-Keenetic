    tools: m4: update to 1.4.20
    
    New m4 release was made after a long time, for us most importantly
    it ships newer gnulib so it compiles against GCC15 without forcing GNU17.
    
    * Noteworthy changes in release 1.4.20 (2025-05-10) [stable]
    
    ** Fix a bug in the `eval' builtin where it does not suppress warnings
       about division by zero that occurs within a more complex expression on
       the right hand side of || or && (present since short-circuiting was
       introduced in 1.4.8b).
    
    ** The `syscmd' and `esyscmd' builtins no longer mishandle a command line
       starting with `-' or `+' (present since "the beginning").
    
    ** Fix regression introduced in 1.4.19 where trace output (such as with
       `debugmode(t)') could read invalid memory when tracing a series of
       pushed macros that are popped during argument collection.
    
    ** Fix regression introduced in 1.4.19 where the `format' builtin
       inadvertently took on locale-dependent parsing and output of floating
       point numbers as a side-effect of introducing message translations.
       While it would be nice for m4 to be fully locale-aware, such a behavior
       change belongs in a major version release such as 1.6, and not a minor
       release.
    
    ** Fix regression introduced in 1.4.11 where the experimental `changeword'
       builtin could cause a crash if given a regex that does not match all
       one-byte prefixes of valid longer matches.  As a reminder, `changeword'
       is not recommended for production use, and will likely not be present
       in the next major version release.
    
    ** On non-Unix platforms where binary files differ from text, loading a
       frozen file (which should be cross-platform compatible) now correctly
       uses binary mode.
    
    ** Several documentation improvements to the manual.
    
    ** Update to comply with newer C standards, and inherit portability
       improvements from gnulib.
