    kernel: Enable CONFIG_ARM64_PAN to restrict kernel access to user space memory
    
    Enable the CONFIG_ARM64_PAN kernel security option, which leverages the
    ARMv8.1 Privileged Access Never (PAN) extension to prevent the kernel
    from directly accessing user space memory.
    
    Instead, copy_to_user and similar functions must be used for data
    transfer between kernel and user space. This feature is automatically
    disabled at runtime on CPUs without PAN support, making it a no-op in
    those cases.
