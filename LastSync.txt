    generic: crypto: fix jitterentropy initialization failed issue
    
    Sync jitterentropy source code with linux-6.12 to solve the
    issue of jitterentropy initialization failed:
    
    [ 9.523489] jitterentropy: Initialization failed with host not compliant with requirements: 9
    [ 9.661916] kmodloader: 1 module could not be probed
    [ 9.662377] kmodloader: - jitterentropy_rng - 0
    
    In linux upstream commit cf27d9475f37 ("crypto: jitter - use
    permanent health test storage"), when FIPS crypto is disabled,
    the health test results are always explicitly skipped. That means
    it will never return error code 9 (health test failed) again.
