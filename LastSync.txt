    realtek: d-link: add support for dgs-1210-28p-f
    
    General hardware info:
    ----------------------
    
    D-Link DGS-1210-28P rev. F1 is a switch with 24 ethernet ports and 4
    combo ports, all ports Gbit capable. It is based on a RTL8382 SoC
    @500MHz, DRAM 128MB and 32MB flash. 24 ethernet ports are 802.3af/at PoE
    capable with a total PoE power budget of 193W.
    
    Power over Ethernet:
    --------------------
    
    The PSE hardware consists of three BCM59121 PSE chips, serving 8 ports
    each. They are controlled by a Nuvoton MCU.  In order to enable PoE, the
    realtek-poe package is required. It is installed by default, but
    currently it requires the manual editing of /etc/config/poe. Keep in
    mind that the port number assignment does not match on this switch,
    alway 8 ports are in reversed order: 8-1, 16-9 and 24-17.
    
    LEDs and Buttons:
    -----------------
    
    On stock firmware, the mode button is supposed to switch the LED
    indicators of all port LEDs between Link Activity and PoE status. The
    currently selected mode is visualized using the respective LEDs. PoE Max
    indicates that the maximum PoE budget has been reached.  Since there is
    currently no support for this behavior, these LEDs and the mode button
    can be used independently.
    
    Serial connection:
    ------------------
    The UART for the SoC (115200 8N1) is available via unpopulated standard
    0.1" pin header marked J6. Pin1 is marked with arrow and square.
    
    Pin 1: Vcc 3.3V
    Pin 2: Tx
    Pin 3: Rx
    Pin 4: Gnd
    
    OEM installation from Web Interface:
    ------------------------------------
    
        1. Make sure you are booting using OEM in image 2 slot. If not,
           switch to
            image2 using the menus
            System > Firmware Information > Boot from image2
            Tools > reboot
        2. Upload image in vendor firmware via Tools > Backup / Upgrade
            Firmware > image1
        3. Toggle startup image via System > Firmware Information > Boot
           from
            image1
        4. Tools > reboot
    
    Other installation methods not tested, but since the device shares the
    board with the DGS-1210-28, the following should work:
    
    Boot initramfs image from U-Boot:
    ---------------------------------
    
        1. Press Escape key during `Hit Esc key to stop autoboot` prompt
        2. Press CTRL+C keys to get into real U-Boot prompt
        3. Init network with `rtk network on` command
        4. Load image with `tftpboot 0x8f000000
            openwrt-rtl838x-generic-d-link_dgs-1210-28p-f-initramfs-kernel.bin`
            command
        5. Boot the image with `bootm` command
