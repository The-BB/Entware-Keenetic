    kernel: Activate CONFIG_NET_SWITCHDEV in generic config
    
    The CONFIG_NET_SWITCHDEV option is needed by CONFIG_DSA and some other
    options. It is boolean, we have to compile it into the kernel it self.
    Activate it for all targets in the generic configuration, it is already
    activated for most of them. This allows to install DSA drivers as a
    module.
    
    On the ramips/mt7620 target the kernel would grown by 4.5kB.
    
    For some small targets which do not support a DSA switch by default the
    option is deactivated.
