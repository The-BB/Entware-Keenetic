    ramips: Fix EX400 imagebuilder
    
    A factory image for DNA EX400 depends on an initramfs image and they
    were explicitly removed from the imagebuilder recently. Now the factory
    image creation fails miserably and it also affects custom image creation
    with the firmware selector.
    
    Add the initramfs kernel to the staging so that it's shipped with the
    imagebuilder. Also remove a image build target added solely for DNA EX400.
    
    Tested by creating a factory and syspupgrade images locally with
    the imagebuilder and verified their functionality.
