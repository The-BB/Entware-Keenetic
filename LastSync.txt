    mediatek: filogic: openwrt-one: drop kmod-nvme
    
    The OpenWrt One is the only board listing kmod-nvme as part of it's
    default package set.
    
    Remove kmod-nvme from the default package set as the board is sold
    without an NVMe SSD and the M.2 slot can also be used for other
    purposes.
