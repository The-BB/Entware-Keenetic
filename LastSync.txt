    generic: mtk_eth_soc: dump registers on forced reset
    
    Import patch from MediaTek's SDK to hack-6.6 which dumps all relevant
    registers of the Ethernet controller in case of a forced reset.
    This can help to debug and find the cause for sporadic resets seen on
    Filogic SoCs when used with OpenWrt's Linux 6.6.
