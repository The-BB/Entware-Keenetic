    utils: Add the omnia-eeprom utility
    
    Add a new utility, `omnia-eeprom`, which can be used to print / set
    EEPROM fields on Turris Omnia.
    
    One example when this utility might be useful is if the board
    experiences random crashes due to newer versions of the DDR training
    algorithm in newer U-Boot. The user can change the DDR speed from 1600K
    to 1333H to solve these issues, with
    
      ```
      omnia-eeprom set ddr_speed 1333H
      ```
